## Project Setup

### User requirements
* You must have a Bandwidth account (https://app.bandwidth.com/).
* You must have a Google Cloud account (https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/).
* You must have a Ngrok account (https://ngrok.com/).

### System requirements
* Python version = 3.7.0
* Ngrok
* git

Instructions for downloading Python 3.7.0 can be found here https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Instructions for downloading Ngrok can be found here https://ngrok.com/download.

Git can be downloaded by running the following command on your terminal:
```
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Launching Ngrok
After installing Ngrok, it can be launched by running the following command:
```
ngrok http 5000
```

You will see a screen that looks like this:

Take note of the HTTPS Forwarding url. You will need this later in setting up the demo.

Leave this command running, and open a new terminal window.

### Repo setup

1. Open up a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory that will hold the project.
3. Run the following commands to setup the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:Bandwidth/cluecon-demo.git
cd cluecon-demo
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 cluecon-demo-virtualenv
source cluecon-demo-virtualenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If done properly, the beginning of your prompt should look like this:
```
(cluecon-demo-virtualenv)
```

Running the command
```
pip freeze
```
should result in an output like this:

### Environmental variables

The following environmental variables must be set:

```
BANDWIDTH_USER_ID
BANDWIDTH_API_TOKEN
BANDWIDTH_API_SECRET 
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
APPLICATION_URL
```

Your Bandwidth credentials can be found here https://app.bandwidth.com/account/profile.

![alt text](images/bandwidth_credentials.png)

Your Google application credentials file can be found here https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/home/
1. Click "APIs & Services" on the left menu.
2. Click "Credentials" on the displayed menu.
3. Click "Create credentials" in the middle of the screen.
4. Select "Service account key".
5. Create a service account.
6. Select your role ("owner" should suffice for this demo)
7. Select "JSON" for key type.

After a few seconds, your file should download. Move this file to a place easily accessible by the demo code, and set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to this file.


The APPLICATION_URL is your Ngrok url shown above.

### Launching the application
Once setup with Ngrok, the cluecon-demo-virtualenv virtual environment, and the environmental variables, launch the application by running the following command:
```
python server/server.py
```

You should be able to go to your https Ngrok url and see the home page of the application.

### Purchasing a Bandwidth Phone Number
By going to your Ngrok url, you should see the flowchart creator for the application. However, any flow you create will not run without a Bandwidth number. The steps to get a Bandwidth number are as follows:

1. Go to https://app.bandwidth.com.
2. Log in to your account.
3. Go to the "Numbers" tab on the top right of the page.
4. Go to the "Buy" tab on the top left of the page.
5. Search for a number by areacode, zipcode, or city.
6. Select your desired phone numbers (note: if you are on a trial account with Bandwidth, select only one phone number due to limited funds in the trial account).
7. Click "Get Numbers" at the bottom of the screen.

You now have Bandwidth numbers to use for your flowchart.
